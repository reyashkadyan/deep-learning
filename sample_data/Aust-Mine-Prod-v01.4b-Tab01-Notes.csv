"This compilation has been developed over many, many years - all librarians, agency staff and colleagues who have helped along the way are kindly acknowledged. The current motivation to update and expand these data was to support Geoscience Australia's National Atlas of Mine Waste (search online).

Whilst much of this research has been compiled for academic research on sustainable mining, at times the efforts have enjoyed financial support from CSIRO and Geoscience Australia.

All indigenous groups and interests in lands where mining has occurred, continues at present or could in the future, are rightfully acknowledged.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstract:,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This data publication is a comprehensive synthesis of production from mines across Australia, including individual mines or fields as well as annual time series data by state. All care has been taken in the preparation of these data, however, some aspects remain incomplete (e.g., refinery by-products) or estimated based on best available data or information (e.g., concentrates). All data are considered the best synthesis possible of public sources.

All users of these data do so at their own risk.

Key references, publications and data sources are noted below.

If there are contributions to add to these data, please contact the author at RMIT.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Key Assumptions & Points to Note:,,,,,,,,,,,,
• All sources used adopted their own quality control and can be considered reliable for the purposes of this compilation.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Data represents the contained metal or minerals within a saleable product leaving a mine gate (e.g., contained metal or minerals in concentrates, doré bars, direct shipping ore, refined metal, saleable ore). (Note: contained metal is not the same as payable metal, which is what a mine gets paid for after deductions by a smelter / refinery).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Where necessary, mineral products have been converted to show contained metal (or element / elements) (e.g., tungsten in wolfram or scheelite, individual platinum group elements).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• All prices are indicative export prices only, based on reported metal or mineral content, presented as unit price ($/t).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Monetary values have been converted to Australian dollars ($), with £ multiplied by 2 to give $.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Every effort has been made to avoid double counting, but there may still be some data overlap.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• All units are metric (e.g., 1 tonne is 1 million grams; g/t are grams per tonne; % is per cent; kt is thousand tonnes; Mt is mega or million tonnes); except diamonds which are in carats (where 1 carat = 0.2 grams).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• The vast majority of data is calendar year, but from the 1980s onwards some data is financial year (i.e., July to June).",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Where value only was reported, this has been converted to metal / mineral based on average prices for that year.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Whilst every effort has been made to reconcile conflicting data sources, some conflicts and inconsistencies remain - if there is a need to address this, please contact the author.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• It is anticipated that additional updates will be included in future (e.g., years beyond 2021, additional minerals) - if there is a desire for help with particular research or analyses, the author is most willing to be consulted and may be able to help.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"• Very minor differences remain between mine production time series (e.g., mined Cu production in column BP) and totals in the Summary or Mine by Mine tabs.",,,,,,,,,,,,
• Any errors - or even additional data to amend or add - please contact the author.,,,,,,,,,,,,
